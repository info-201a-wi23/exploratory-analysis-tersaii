For public institutions, this metric is limited to undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all undergraduates who receive Title IV aid.

Income categories are calculated from the income values used by the institution to calculate financial aid eligibility. For a dependent student, this includes the student’s and the parents’ income.

Average net price (NPT4_PUB, NPT4_PRIV) for each of the following three aggregated income categories: $0–$48,000; $48,001–$75,000; $75,001 or more. For public institutions, this metric is limited to undergraduates who pay in-state tuition and receive Title IV aid. For private institutions, it includes all undergraduates who receive Title IV aid. The total cost of attendance depends on whether undergraduates live on campus, off campus (not with family), or off campus (with family).
Income categories are calculated from the income values used by the institution to calculate financial aid eligibility. For a dependent student, this includes the student’s and the parents’ income. For an independent student, this includes the student’s adjusted gross income and, if the student is married, the spouse’s income. This metric is not available prior to the 2008–09 academic year.
